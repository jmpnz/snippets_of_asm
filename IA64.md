# Intel 64-bit

These notes are short and sweet and used as a remainder of things I've often
gotten confused about.

The complete set of Intel manuals should always be checked for more details.

If you need to quickly find what an instruction does you can use the exellent

## The Stack

The hardware stack is a special region of memory where stack semantics apply
i.e `push` and `pop`. In Intel's 64 and 32 bit architectures the stack is
upside down and starts at a high address e.g 0xffffffff, that's why the stack
looks "upside down" because the bottom is at the highest memory address of the
process.

Intel uses a special register `ESP/RSP` used to point at the top of the stack,
this register is called the **stack pointer**, the value in the register **changes
automatically** when you use the `push` & `pop` instructions.

### Stack Operations

You can store things on the stack in two ways :

* `push rax` : Stores the contents of the `rax` register in the stack.
* `sub rsp, 8; mov [rsp], eax` : Make space on the stack by subtracting the number
   of bytes you need and move the value to the memory address pointed at by `rsp`.


For example to store the value `0xDEADBEEF` on the stack (assuming it's stored in
`rax`) :

```asm

sub esp, 4
mov [rsp], eax

```

```asm

push eax

```

```
 ---------- 0xffffffff
|          |
|          |
|          |
|          |
|          |
|          |
|          |
|          |
|          |
|          |
|          |
 ---------- 0xffffaabb  <- ESP ; The top of the stack before our instructions
|   DE     |
|   AD     |
|   BE     |
|   EF     |
 ---------- 0xffffaab7 <- ESP ; The top of the stack after our instructions.

```

### Stack Frames and Calling Conventions

Stack frames are a region in the stack memory that is *local* to a function
call and holds a logical reference to *return* from the call.

The stackframe will usually hold the following :

* Space for arguments beyond the first 7 (The first 7 arguments are passed in registers)
* Space for local variables
* Memory address of the caller
* Registers that should not be clobbered saved by the called function in case they are used (called callee saved)

Calling conventions specify how registers are used, usually each triplet `machine-vendor-os`
will have it's own. For example Intel & AMD 64 bit on Linux for most vendors will support
the [System V ABI](https://refspecs.linuxbase.org/elf/x86_64-abi-0.99.pdf).

For example consider the following snippet and the annotated assembly output following it
start reading the assembly from the `caller`.

You will notice that we didn't *make space for local variables* in callee, that's also an
ABI thing. That's because the 128-byte memory space beyond the location pointer at by `rsp`
i.e the range `[rsp..rsp - 128]` is called the **red zone** and the ABI tells you the following :

```

The 128-byte area beyond the location pointed to by %rsp is considered to be reserved and shall
not be modified by signal or interrupt handlers. Therefore, functions may use this area for temporary
data that is not needed across function calls.

In particular, leaf functions may use this area for their entire stack frame, rather than adjusting
the stack pointer in the prologue and epilogue. This area is known as the red zone.

In this case `callee` doesn't call another function so it's a **leaf function** and can therefore
use the red zone and avoid allocations and restores in the epilogue and prologue.

The **prologue** is basically `push rbp; mov rbp, rsp;` and the **epilogue** is `pop rbp; ret` since
the pattern of using `rbp` (The base register) to find things in the current stack frame is
omnipresent in most x86-64 code the process of saving and restoring `rbp` is global to every
function call you'll see (even empty functions at optimization level 0 i.e `-O0` will have it).

- **Callee-saved** : registers used by the *called function* if it uses them they must be restored
    for the System V ABI (`rbx`, `rbp`, `rsp`, `r12..r15`).

- **Caller-saved** : registers saved by the *calling function* if they are *used after the call*
    if they are not used they don't need to be saved (can be clobbered).

```c

int callee(int a, int b, int c)
{
    int x = a + 2;
    int y = b + 3;
    int z = c + 4;
    int sum = x * y + z;

    return sum;
}

int caller()
{
    return foobar(77, 88, 99);
}

```

```c

callee:
        // This saves the value of `rbp` before `call callee`
        // was executed. This is equivalent to `sub rsp, 8`.
        push    rbp
        // Use the current stack pointer as a reference in `rbp`
        mov     rbp, rsp
        // Store the first argument at the memory address of `[rbp - 20]`
        mov     DWORD PTR [rbp-20], edi
        // Store the second argument at the memory address of `[rbp -24]`
        mov     DWORD PTR [rbp-24], esi
        // Store the last argument at the memory address of `[rbp - 28]`
        mov     DWORD PTR [rbp-28], edx
        // Store 77 in `eax`.
        mov     eax, DWORD PTR [rbp-20]
        // eax = 77 + 2
        add     eax, 2
        // Store eax at `[rbp - 4]`, this is in the redzone.
        mov     DWORD PTR [rbp-4], eax
        // Now move 88 into `eax` to the second computation.
        mov     eax, DWORD PTR [rbp-24]
        add     eax, 3
        // Store back `eax` at `[rbp - 8]` this is also in the redzone.
        mov     DWORD PTR [rbp-8], eax
        // Finally the last computation.
        mov     eax, DWORD PTR [rbp-28]
        add     eax, 4
        // Store back `eax` at `[rbp - 12]`.
        mov     DWORD PTR [rbp-12], eax
        // Now we compute `sum`.
        mov     eax, DWORD PTR [rbp-4]
        imul    eax, DWORD PTR [rbp-8]
        mov     edx, eax
        mov     eax, DWORD PTR [rbp-12]
        add     eax, edx
        mov     DWORD PTR [rbp-16], eax
        // Store `sum` at `eax` which is where the return value is stored.
        mov     eax, DWORD PTR [rbp-16]
        // Restore `rbp` to it's old value.
        pop     rbp
        // Ret uses the address stored at the stop of the stack to return
        // execution there.
        ret
caller:
        // `caller` will use `rbp` so it needs to save it
        // and restore it for the function that calls `caller`.
        push    rbp
        // Store the current value of the stack pointer in `rbp`
        // locally to "move around" its stack frame a function
        // will use `rbp` as a reference point since `rsp` changes
        // as instructions down the line modify the stack.
        mov     rbp, rsp
        // Move the last argument to `edx` this follows the ABI
        mov     edx, 99
        // Move the second from last argument to `esi`
        mov     esi, 88
        // Move the first argument to `edi`.
        mov     edi, 77
        // The call instructions pushes the current instruction pointer
        // to the stack, the instruction pointer points to the instruction
        // **after** `call callee` i.e `pop rbp`.
        // It is equivalent to `push rip; jmp [callee]`
        // From here start reading `callee`.
        call    callee.
        pop     rbp
        ret
