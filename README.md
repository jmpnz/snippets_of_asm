# Snippets of assembly

These are some short notes I wrote while learning AARCH64 assembly, I've used
the same process to learn x86-64 a very long time ago and the technique has
yet to fail, I've also included some notes on x86-64 after I needed a refresher.

The crux is to write some C code and dump it's disassembly which with Godbolt
has become much more simple.
